            im sorry if you never recieved any new letters from me for the past few months<br>
        there was a problem at the post office here at imus, something that has to do with the past typhoon<br>
    typhoon yunya, the post office lost contact with the other offices out there, the wind and storm was<br>
so strong it crumbled some houses out here, the post office was one of the buildings that got damaged along the others<br>
and also another reason why i couldnt write back at you<br>
im sorry angie, and if your wondering, me and elicio are fine, our house suffered a bit from the typhoon<br>
but fortunately we stayed at the evacuation centre for some weeks until it was safe to go out again<br>
speaking about the typhoon, are you ok on there?, im worried sick when the typhoon entered in this country<br>
knowing you live by the sea, you must had suffered alot, i hope your fine, and if you are, i hope i can get ya outta that town<br>
and bring you with us to live together, just like what i promised you<br>
i hope your doing well there, and i hope you ate well<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
-love, saguita
